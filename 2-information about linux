------------------what is computer----------------------
computer is an IP enabled device.communication between two computer
using ip address.like servers mobiles,laptops,washing mechines,AC's 
etc..these are all called computers.based on the use we can call 
it different names
Server -> hosting the applications
Computer -> Internet browsing, songs, videos, banking, etc
Mobile -> Calling, Social media, etc.
 In computer we have RAM, CPU(processor), Storage, OS.
 RAM, CPU(processor), Storage---these are called hardware.
 OS---It is bridge between hardware and software.
 
 Windows
=========
heavy graphics
more Cost
Slow
heavy resources consumption
performance -> frequent restarts
Security -> Anti virus installation is mandatory
upgrade to other version is little tough

Linux Server edition
===================
Opensource
Free
no graphics, only text
super fast
less resources -> 9MB of OS can be installed
run for years without restart
by default security is present in OS
upgrade is easy
Learning curve.

Availability zone---isolation data centers in a region is called AZ.
Region---------region is nothing but a geographycal area.region has 
multiple AZ, atleast 2 AZ.
what is cloud---cloud is nothing but a remote location.remote location
is nothing but a data center.
North virginia is the first AWS region. Cost is less compared to any 
other regions us-east-1.

EC2 -> Elastic compute cloud.In EC2 we have lot of components.

AMI(Amazon machine image) -> OS.example-t2.micro or
t3.micro --> free tier.t3.micro -> 2 CPU, 1GB RAM

Firewall----using Scurity group we can setup this firewall.
it will allow the incomming and outgoing traffics.

authentication----what you know? -> Username and password
what you have? -> Username, RSA/OTP/Google/Microsoft auth
what you are? -> finger prints, retina, palm, etc.

SSH -> Secure Shell.Port -> 22

Client Server architecture
==========================
Whoever provide service they are servers

Lawyer -> Servers
Public -> Clients

facebook.com server, client is browser

Linux Server -> clients -> putty, mobaxterm, cmd, mac terminal, git bash, etc..

git bash is one of the SSH client, git client and a mini linux in windows, etc.

once we open git bash, it lands into user directory

C:\Users\<your-lap-username>

C:\Users\siva

Windows -> \(backward)
Linux -> /(forward)

Git Bash -> You can run basic linux commands in windows, but not completely

C:\devops\daws-86s

cd /c/devops/daws-86s
 
ssh-keygen -f <filename(daws-86s)>------>this command will create public and pravite keys 
in daws-86s

ssh -i <private-key name> ec2-user@98.80.251.7
this command is use to connect the server.by default ec2-user is user.

cd--change directory
pwd--present working directory
ls-l  list the files
